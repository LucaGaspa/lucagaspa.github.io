# LucaGaspa GitHub Pages

This is a simple Jekyll theme created for building my personal website with Obsidian and Github Pages. Check out [the original demo](https://jekyll-garden.github.io/).

## Installation (Github pages)

### Part 2, setting Github Repo with Obsidian.

- Step 1: Go to `yourusername.github.io`, and clone your repository to your machine. For this, you can use git-commands or install Github for desktop.
- Step 2: Once you have successfully cloned the repository to your machine, Open the Obsidian app, and set the folder `_notes` inside the repository as your vault.
- Step 3: You can start adding notes to this vault and add frontmatter to support. Read about YAML at `Welcome to the garden`.
- Step 4: Once you have enough notes, got to the Github Desktop app, commit the changes to main, and push the changes to Github. Github will update the pages!

## Contribution

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install` after cloning this repository in your local machine.

Your theme is set up just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. `_notes` contain all atomic notes. If you want to use this for blog, add posts inside `_posts` folder, following standard Jekyll frontamtter.
